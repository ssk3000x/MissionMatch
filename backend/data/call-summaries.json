Thank you.\nUser: Yeah.\nAI: To help the project organizer move forward, could I ask a few quick questions? 1, who would be the best person for the organizer to contact\nUser: Yeah. Sure.\nAI: about volunteering or partnering with your food bank? 2, what's the best way to reach them? Phone, email, or another method? 3, are there any specific requirements or steps the volunteer needs to follow? Before getting involved? Like an application, orientation or or or background check. 4, what kind of support can your organization offer? Volunteer opportunities, food donations, logistical help, etcetera? Once I have this information, I'll make sure the organizer reaches out to the right person. And follows your process. Thanks again for your time.\nUser: Yeah.\nAI: Great. Thank you.\nUser: Yeah. So I think I think they can they should definitely reach out to to us and let us know what they think. But I think you're asking a bit too many questions right now. I'm not sure if I can answer all of them. However, I think that if you reach out to us via email or our Instagram page, I can definitely help out.\nAI: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your openness and your time. That's completely understandable. And I don't wanna take up too much of it. I'll let the project organizer know know that they can reach out to you directly via email or Instagram to discuss how they can get involved and what support might be available. Just to confirm, is there a specific email address or Instagram handle they should use to contact you? That way, I can make sure they reach the right place.\nUser: Yes. It's called noel thomas at gmail dot com, and that's it. I have to go right now, but goodbye.\nAI: You so much for the information. Noll thomas at g mail dot com. I'll pass that along to the project organizer. I appreciate your time and assistance. And, um, hope you have a great day. Goodbye.\nUser: Yep. You too.\nAI: Thank you. Take\n",
